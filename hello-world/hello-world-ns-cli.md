# Hello World from the NativeScript CLI

Have you set up your system to develop NativeScript apps with the NativeScript CLI local tool set? 

If the answer is yes, you are ready to create your first Hello World app with NativeScript. Your first Hello World will be a simple counter. You will learn:

* [How To Create a New Project](#create-new-project)
* [How To Add User Interface](#1-add-user-interface)
* [How To Create a View Model](#2-create-the-view-model)
* [How To Style Your App](#3-style-your-app)

> If your system is not already configured, you can check the [Set Up Your System](../setup/quick-setup.md) guide, pick your tools and configure them.

## Create New Project

The first step to any development is to create your first project.

### 1. Create your project.

In the command prompt, run the following command.

```
tns create hello-world
```

### 2. Add target development platforms.

Before you can run your code, NativeScript needs to initialize a platform-specific native project for each platform you intend to target.

```
cd hello-world
tns platform add ios
tns platform add android
```

This operation uses the native SDKs to initialize the platform-specific projects and places the generated contents in your app's `platforms` directory. Later on, the NativeScript CLI will use the tools of the native SDKs to build these platform-specific projects into truly native application packages. During the process, the NativeScript CLI will automatically transfer your cross-platform code and resources from your project's `app` directory into its `platforms` directory.

You'll see a more detailed breakdown of a NativeScript app's directory structure momentarily, but first let's get your new app up and running.

### 3. You can quickly check how your blank project looks like in the emulator or on device.

After adding platform(s), you can use `tns run` to run your app. For example, the following runs your app in the iOS Simulator or an [Android AVD](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/using-android-emulator-hybrid-mobile-apps-telerik-appbuilder/) configured on your machine.

```iOS
tns run ios --emulator
```
```Android
tns run android --emulator
```

> **TIP:** If you have configured Genymotion, you can run `tns run android --emulator --geny <Genymotion Device Name>`<br/>This runs your project in the Genymotion emulator.

You can deploy your app to physical, USB-connected devices by omitting the `--emulator` flag. The following command deploys your app to USB-connected iOS or Android device.

```iOS
tns run ios
```
```Android
tns run android
```

> **WARNING**: Deploying your app to iOS devices requires that a valid iOS certificate and provisioning profile pair are configured on your development machine. For more information, see [iOS Code Signing - A Complete Walkthrough](http://seventhsoulmountain.blogspot.com/2013/09/ios-code-sign-in-complete-walkthrough.html).

By default `tns create` scaffolds a small sample project which should look like this on your device or emulator.

### 4. Explore the newly created project.

Your first NativeScript project uses the following basic directories and files.

```
.
└── hello-world
    ├── app
    │   ├── app.css
    │   ├── app.js
    │   ├── bootstrap.js
    │   ├── main-page.js
    │   ├── main-page.xml
    │   ├── App_Resources
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── tns_modules
    │       └── ...
    └── platforms
        └── ...

```

Here's a guide to what these files do:

* The `app` directory is the **development space for your application**.
* The `platforms` directory is created empty. When you add a target platform to your project, the NativeScript CLI creates a new subdirectory with the platform name. The subdirectory contains the ready-to-build platform-specific resources of your app. 
* The `App_Resources` subdirectory is the directory that contains **platform-specific resources** such as icons, splash screens and platform-specific configuration files like `AndroidManifest.xml` and `Info.plist`. When you create a new project, only icons and splash screens are present in this directory.
* The `tns_modules` subdirectory contains the NativeScript modules. Each module exposes a device or platform functionality such as the camera, location services or the user interface.
* `app.js` is the starting point for the logic of your app. In the sample app, `app.js` sets the app's `mainModule`, or the first page in your sample app, to `main-page`, which effectively gives control to the `main-page.js` and `main-page.xml` files.

> **IMPORTANT**: Avoid modifying your projects inside the `platforms` directory. During build-related operations, your changes will be overridden by your code and resources from the `app` directory.

## Build Something Awesome

Now that you have an app running, let's switch up the NativeScript-generated sample to introduce some of NativeScript's features. In this step you'll build a simple task manager. Although very basic, this app will introduce you to building UIs, implementing MVVM, and styling NativeScript apps with CSS. 

### 1. Add user interface

NativeScript uses an XML structure to define UI components. Your app has one page, which has its UI defined in `main-page.xml`. In the same `app` directory, create a sibling file named `tasks.xml` and paste in the following contents. 

```XML
<Page loaded="onPageLoaded">
    <GridLayout rows="auto, *">
        <StackLayout orientation="horizontal" row="0">
            {%raw%}<TextField width="200" text="{{ task }}" hint="Enter a task" id="task" />
            <Button text="Add" tap="add"></Button>
        </StackLayout>

        <ListView items="{{ tasks }}" row="1">
            <ListView.itemTemplate>
                <Label text="{{ name }}" />{%endraw%}
            </ListView.itemTemplate>
        </ListView>
    </GridLayout>
</Page>
```

Take note of a few things here. The first is that this uses two of [NativeScript's layout mechanisms](../layouts.md): `GridLayout` and `StackLayout`. The `GridLayout` provides an elegant way to divide an area of the screen into rows and columns. In this case you divide the screen into two rows: a `StackLayout` at the top and a `ListView` at the bottom.

The `StackLayout` is simpler — it stacks things horizontally or vertically. In this example you override the default orientation, vertical, to display a `TextField` and a `Button` next to each other.

Did you notice the double curly brace syntax used in the XML (e.g. `text="{%raw%}{{ name }}{%endraw%}"`)? This configures NativeScript's data binding syntax. Let's see how it works.

> **TIP**: For more on what you can do with UIs in NativeScript, check out [UI: The Basics](../ui-with-xml.md) article.

### 2. Create the view model

The NativeScript framework is optimized for mobile development which follows the [MVVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel) pattern. This pattern provides an elegant approach to keeping your model data in sync with your UI. To see how it works, create a `tasks.js` file in the same directory as your existing `tasks.xml` file and paste in the following code.

```JavaScript
var observableModule = require("data/observable");
var observableArray = require("data/observable-array");
var viewModule = require("ui/core/view");

var tasks = new observableArray.ObservableArray([]);
var pageData = new observableModule.Observable();
var page;

exports.onPageLoaded = function(args) {
    page = args.object;
    pageData.set("task", "");
    pageData.set("tasks", tasks);
    page.bindingContext = pageData;
};

exports.add = function() {
    tasks.push({ name: pageData.get("task") });
    pageData.set("task", "");
    viewModule.getViewById( page, "task" ).dismissSoftInput();
};
```

The first thing to notice here is the use of the `exports` keyword. If you are familiar with Node.js, you have probably noticed that NativeScript modules adhere to the [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS) spec. If you are not familiar with Node.js, all you need to know is that the `exports` keyword exposes a JavaScript module's public API. In this case, the `exports` keyword exposes two functions to this page's view: `onPageLoaded` and `add`. The view's `<Page>` binds to the `onPageLoaded` function with `<Page loaded="onPageLoaded">`, and the view's `<Button>` binds to the `add` function with `<Button tap="add"></Button>`.

The other thing to note is the `page.bindingContext = pageData` assignment in the `onPageLoaded` function. This line sets the `pageData` `Observable` object as the *binding context* of this page. Simply put, this line means that properties of the `pageData` object are accessible in the UI components using the `{%raw%}{{ }}{%endraw%}` syntax. For example, the page's `<ListView>` binds to the `pageData` object's `tasks` property using `{%raw%}<ListView items="{{ tasks }}">{%endraw%}`.

The biggest benefit of this MVVM approach is that NativeScript keeps your user interface up-to-date as your data changes. For example, consider the first line of the `add()` function:

```JavaScript
tasks.push({ name: pageData.get("task") });
```

Because the `tasks` array is set up as an `ObservableArray` and because the `tasks` array is bound to the page's `<ListView>` (`{%raw%}<ListView items="{{ tasks }}">{%endraw%}`), this call adds the user-provided value to the list shown on the screen automatically.

This code is not only clean, it also helps to decouple your XML UI declaration from your JavaScript logic. In this case, your JavaScript does not need to know which UI components are bound to this data; it just manages JavaScript objects and lets the XML take care of the rest. NativeScript fully embraces this separation-of-concerns-based approach to building apps and this approach extends to how you style your apps.

> **TIP**: For more details on how NativeScript's data binding works, check out our [Data Binding](../bindings.md) documentation.

### 3. Style your app

Now that you have a small functioning app, let's see how you can change the looks of your app. Styling in NativeScript is done with a [subset of the CSS syntax](../styling.md).

For each page, the NativeScript runtime automatically loads and applies any CSS file that has the same name as the XML file for the page. Under the hood, the runtime parses the CSS, evaluates the selectors and applies the properties to the style object of the selected view.

NativeScript also provides an `app.css` file that contains global CSS rules that apply to each page. To add a little spacing to your task manager app, open `app.css` and replace its contents with the following code:

```CSS
label {
    margin: 15;
}
textfield {
    margin: 15;
}
```

> **TIP**: For a more in-depth look at styling NativeScript apps, including a list of support CSS properties, check out our [styling](../styling.md) article.

### 4. The finishing touches

To switch your app to use the new tasks page as a home page, open `app.js` and replace its contents with the following code.

```JavaScript
var application = require("application");
application.mainModule = "tasks";
application.start();
```

With this modification in place, make sure to save all your changed files, including the updated `app.js`, `app.css`, `tasks.js`, and `tasks.xml` files and then re-run your app with the `tns run` command. The following command run the project on the iOS simulator.

```iOS
tns run ios --emulator
```

You should see something that looks like this.

And the following runs the project on an Android simulator.

```Android
tns run android --emulator
```

This time you should see an app that looks like this.
