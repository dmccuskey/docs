* [Fixed #658](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/658): The `$ tns platform remove` command does not remove framework data from `package.json` for the project.
* [Fixed #644](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/644): You cannot build your app for Android, if it contains a custom `styles.xml`.
* [Fixed #632](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/632): On OS X systems with custom Chrome builds, you cannot debug Android apps. To be able to debug Android apps, you need to set the name of the custom Chrome build in the `ANDROID_DEBUG_UI_MAC` setting in `config.json`.
* [Fixed #629](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/629): The `$ tns prepare` command does not populate the platform-specific directories correctly, if your project contains both an npm module, installed using `$ npm install`, and a NativeScript plugin, installed using `$ tns plugin add`.

1.1.2 (2015, July 2)
==

### New

* [Implemented #600](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/600): Added the `$ tns init` command. You can use it to initialize a NativeScript project for development. The command recreates or updates the `package.json` file of the project. You can then run `$ tns install` to install the platforms and dependencies described in the `package.json` file.
* [Implemented #587](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/587): Added the `$ tns install` command. You can use it to quickly install all platforms and dependencies described in a `package.json` file.

### Fixed

* [Fixed #606](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/606): The NativeScript CLI lets you run `<Platform>`-based commands on operating systems which do not support development for this platform. For example, you can run `$ tns build ios` on a Windows system.
* [Fixed #601](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/601): The NativeScript CLI does not treat the dependencies of devDependencies as devDependencies.
* [Fixed #599](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/599): The NativeScript CLI always creates a `tmp` directory in the current directory when you run any command and modifies the `package.json` file for the project.
* [Fixed #584](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/584): The NativeScript CLI references the files in the project with their absolute paths instead of their relative paths. This might cause the project to stop working when transfered to another location and might cause issues with your application packages.
* [Fixed #578](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/578): Platform-specific files in NativeScript plugins are not processed correctly. The NativeScript CLI copies them to the correct platform-specific directory but does not rename them correctly.
* [Fixed #520](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/520): iOS resources from the `App_Resources` folder are not included in the native Xcode project and are not accessible in the application package.

1.1.1 (2015, June 17)
==

### New

* [Implemented #551](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/551): You can now develop for Android 5.1.1 (API Level 22). If you have this SDK installed on your system, the CLI will set it as the default target SDK when you run `$ tns platform add android`
* [Implemented #552](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/552): You can now set the target Android SDK for your project by specifying the `--sdk ` option for `$ tns platform add android` operations.

### Fixed

* [Fixed #555](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/555): In some cases, the CLI merges incorrectly the plugin platform-specific `AndroidManifest.xml` or `Info.plist` with the respective platform-specific configuration files from the project.
* [Fixed #567](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/567): You cannot use npm as a package manager inside your project.
* [Fixed #569](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/569): On some Windows systems, the CLI installation shows errors in the console.

1.1.0 (2015, June 10)
==

### Breaking

* Replaced `.tnsproject` with `package.json` to let you use npm and work with custom plugins in your project.<br/>The first time you run any NativeScript command on an existing project, your `.tnsproject` file will be automatically transformed into a `package.json` file describing your project configuration and data. After this, make sure to commit and push your changes if you are using version control.<br/>After the transformation is complete, you can install and use custom NativeScript plugins inside your project.

### New

* [Implemented #510](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/510): You can work with custom NativeScript plugins in your project. You can add a plugin from an npm package, a local folder, a URL or a `.tar.gz` file. For more information, run `$ tns help plugin`
* [Implemented #362](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/362): You can use npm as package manager for your NativeScript projects.

* [Fixed #324](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/324): When you run commands for the `ios` platform, the NativeScript CLI might show the following unrelated adb warning: `Unable to find adb in PATH. Default one from %s resources will be used.`
* [Fixed #309](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/309): You cannot open the device log for streaming with the `tns device log` command.

### Fixed

* [Fixed #498](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-cli/issues/498): On some Linux and OS X systems, when the USER or SUDO_USER environment variables are missing, you cannot run NativeScript CLI commands.
